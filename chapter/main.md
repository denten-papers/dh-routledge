Many digital humanists tend to fall into the field by accident. They are often
"reformed" software engineers that return to graduate school to pursue degrees
in History or English (like me); "side-steppers," who move laterally from STEM
into STEAM; and self-taught prodigies of all kinds, who take a few classes here
and there, online and during the summer, to essentially create a field and
a training program of their own. I love the do-it-yourself spirit that prevails
in the field, but I would also like to take a moment here to imagine a more
rational path. As the field matures and becomes institutionalized into
degree-granting programs and certificates, we can start thinking of training
digital humanists from the ground up, in an organic manner, starting with the
basics and moving up to advanced research.

In short, learn to code. Critical practice in humanities computing, close
reading, slow, deliberate, self-reflective, probing.

Python and R. Advantages of each. Shell.

Starting form the ground. Native corpus.
