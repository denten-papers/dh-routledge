Digital humanists tend to fall into computational methods by accident. They are
often "reformed" software engineers that return to graduate school to pursue
degrees in History or English (like me); "side-steppers," who move laterally
from STEM into STEAM; and self-taught prodigies of all kinds, who take a few
classes here and there, online and during the summer, to essentially create a
field and a training program of their own. I love the do-it-yourself spirit
that prevails in the field, but I would also like to take a moment here to
imagine a more rational path. As the field matures and becomes
institutionalized into degree- and certificate- granting programs, we can begin
thinking of training digital humanists from the ground up, in an organic
manner, starting with the basics and moving up to advanced research. This
chapter will describe an approach to teaching computational methodology that
goes beyond mere "programming" to an ideal of critical computing practice: a
deliberate, probing, and deeply self-reflective engagement with technology.

In short, learn to code. When it Critical practice in humanities computing,
close reading, slow, deliberate, self-reflective, probing.
