# Statement of Aims

The purpose of this volume is to introduce academic readers, along with a
broader audience, to the new and growing field of the Digital Humanities (DH),
particularly as that field intersects with the research program in the study of
literature. My approach to writing a volume of this sort aims to achieve two
goals: *first*, descriptive, giving shape and intellectual history to the
variety of scholarly practices that loosely identify as the Digital Humanities,
and *second*, aspirational, imagining a future for the field more inclusive and
more intelligible to concomitant developments in the life of the modern
university.

As universities across the country and globally invest in programs related to
the digital humanities,[^ln-dh] a need arises for a programmatic vision of a
field that can guide the formation of certificate programs, research labs, and
undergraduate curricula. I plan for the present volume to answer the demand for
such a vision and to go further by creating a paradigmatic "introduction to the
field," which can go on to serve as a foundational text in the study of
literature inflected by the Digital Humanities. Beyond these goals, I join the
editors of the Routledge Literature and Contemporary Thought series in the
desire to create a mutually enriching dialog between literary criticism,
theory, and recent developments in the digital humanities and computational
culture studies.

[^ln-dh]: For example: In February 2015, U. Penn received $7,000,000 from Penn
Arts and Sciences Overseer to establish the Price Lab for the Digital
Humanities. In December 2014, Yale announced an award in the amount of
$3,000,000 from The Goizueta Foundation to inaugurate the Digital Humanities
Laboratory. UC Berkeley announced $2,000,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation to advance digital humanities. Stanford has recently launched the
Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. University of Michigan opened six new
tenure-track searches in a hiring cluster under the rubric of Public Humanities
in a Digital World in 2012. In May of 2014, Bard College was Awarded $800,000
from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support Experimental Humanities. The
Claremont Colleges received $1,500,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to
develop the digital humanities.

# Definition of the Market

The primary market for *Literature and the Digital Humanities* includes:

- advanced undergraduate courses in literary studies wishing to introduce their
  students to the field of digital humanities and computational culture
studies;

- introductory level graduate courses for all doctorate and MA-level students
  entering the field of literary studies, covering DH as part of their "Intro
to the Field," "Pro-seminar," or "MA seminar," as required in most language and
literature programs globally and across the country;

- the large share of self-directed graduate students whose institutions do not
  offer DH training;

- faculty and staff (librarians, officers of scholarly publications) interested
  in expanding their research and activity in the field.

A secondary market for the book includes students and scholars in engineering
schools interested in finding productive intersections between literary studies
and computer science.

Several prominent institutions are beginning to offer degree- or
certificate-granting programs in Digital Humanities. These include
undergraduate, MA, and PhD programs at King's College London, University
College, London, and University College, Cork; undergraduate and MA programs at
Loyola University, Chicago; the Digital Humanities Minor at UCLA; the DH
undergraduate program at Michigan State University; the DH and Technology
program at Brigham Young; the MA program in Humanities Computing at University
of Alberta, Canada; the MA program in DH at CUNY; the Digital Cultures and
Creativity undergraduate program at University of Maryland; the MA in DH at
Brandeis University; the MA in Digital Humanities at the University of
Virginia; Media Technology and Games program at the IT University of
Copenhagen; MA and PhD in Digital Humanities at Maynooth University, Ireland;
the Digital Media and Cultural Theory undergraduate program at Hampshire
College, Amherst; the Certificate program in DH at University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill; the Arts, Media + Engineering undergraduate program at Arizona
State; the Bachelor of Science in Digital Humanities at the Illinois Institute
of Technology, and many others, along with undergraduate minors and
non-degree-granting research centers that offer courses too numerous to mention
here.

Although I have concentrated my summary of potential markets on universities in
English-speaking countries (primarily Canada, the Republic of Ireland, the
United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States), there are
significant markets for English-language work in DH globally. Institutions in
Sweden, Germany, Israel, and Denmark, among other places, are particularly
strong in this field and commonly assign English texts.

# Review of the Main Competitive Books

There is a paucity of texts that occupy the niche targeted by the Literature
and Contemporary Thought series at the intersection of DH and literary studies.
The existing books could be classified into two major clusters: one, geared
towards a more general audience of the humanistic disciplines at large; and
cluster, specific to individual constituent disciplines.

The formative cluster of books about the Digital Humanities more generally
includes:

- *Companion to Digital Humanities*, ed. John M. Unsworth, Susan Schreibman,
  and Ray Siemens (Willey-Blackwell, 2004),[^ln-comp]
- *Understanding Digital Humanities*, ed. David M. Berry (Palgrave Macmillan,
  2012),[^ln-understand]
- *Debates in Digital Humanities*, ed. Matt Gold (Minnesota, 2012),[^ln-debates]
- *Digital_Humanities* (MIT, 2012) by Jeffrey Schnapp, Johanna Drucker, Anne
  Burdick, Peter Lunenfeld, and Todd Presner, [^ln-dh2]
- *The Emergence of the Digital Humanities* by Steven Jones (Routledge,
  2013),[^ln-jones] and
- *Hacking the Academy: New Approaches to Scholarship and Teaching from Digital
  Humanities* by Dan Cohen and Joseph Scheinfeldt (Michigan UP, 2015).[^ln-up]

The "second generation" wave of DH is beginning to absorb the impact of the
research program and administrative reform proposed by the first into its
constituent fields. I hold that such specification is not only necessary, but
also that it reaches a much wider audience. The application of the Digital
Humanities to specific questions in literary scholarship, as they manifest in
pressing problems of collaborative authorship, digital storytelling, the
quality of online deliberation, and in the politics of the archive and shared
memory formation (to name just a few), is beginning to gain a measure of specificity
that points to concrete ways of collaboration between diverse practitioners.
Such questions are interesting to computer scientists and game designers alike.

A small number of recent books have begun to direct generalist DH approaches
and methodologies to the questions and traditions governing their specific area
of expertise. To this category we may attribute:

- *Writing History in the Digital Age* by Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki
  (Michigan UP, 2013),^[ln-hist]
- *Digital Critical Editions*, ed. Daniel Apollon et. al. (U of Illinois,
  2014),[^ln-critical] and
- *Oral History and Digital Humanities: Voice, Access, and Engagement* Ed.
  Douglas A. Boyd and Mary A. Larson (Palgrave, 2014).[^ln-palgrave]

Some of the few major volumes in the nascent second generation pertinent to the
study of literature include:

- *Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism* by Stephen Ramsay (U.
  Illinois Press, 2011),[^ln-ramsay]
- *Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History* by Matthew L. Jockers
  (Illinois, 2013),[^ln-macro] which itself builds on the influential *Distant
Reading* by Franco Moretti (Verso, 2013),[^ln-franco] and
- *Digital Literary Studies: Corpus Approaches to Poetry, Prose, and Drama* by
  David Hoover et.al. (Routledge, 2014).[^ln-hoover]

In *Literature and the Digital Humanities*, my approach builds on these volumes
to connect the history of the discipline to the Digital Humanities research
program in an evolutionary way. Going beyond computation, I plan to describe DH
as an expansion of the literary-critical tradition, opening up to new archives
of study and to new methodologies. My book ends with a productive critique of
the field itself: noting its successes and outlining strategies to remedy its
failures. I want my reader to leave the book with a sense of possibility:
perceiving rich and yet unexplored areas of scholarship needing our urgent
attention.

# Chapter Outline

## Part I: Interfaces

### Chapter 1: Literature and the Digital Humanities Now

The first chapter will pose and begin answering the question shaping the rest
of the book: What are the digital humanities? and Why do they matter? In making
a broad summary of the field, I organize the variety of existing practices into
three main categories. The *first* deals with computational approaches to the
study of literature and culture. Like the computational turn affecting many
other disciplines, advancements in natural language processing techniques and
the widespread availability of computational power have made it possible for
scholars to ask qualitatively new questions, at scales of analysis which
include reading at distance (macroanalysis) and textual forensics
(microanalysis of the kind advocated by Matthew Kirschenbaum in his
*Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination*, 2008).

I summarize the *second* broad category of activity under the rubric of
"knowledge design." In this category we find long-standing scholarly practices
of critical edition-making, textual scholarship, and archive formation, along
with new concerns related to digitization, tagged corpora, and collaborative
annotation, exemplified by projects like *NINES* (Nineteenth-century
Scholarship Online, U. Virginia), the *Perseus Digital Library* (Ed. Gregory
Crane, Tufts U.), and *HyperCities* (UCLA), among many others.

Finally, I identify the third type of activity as "institutional
transformation." To this category we may ascribe work by Daniel Cohen and
Joseph Scheinfeldt (*Hacking the Academy*, 2015); *4Humanities* site curated by
Alan Liu, Geoffrey Rockwell and Melissa Terras; and the *Media Commons* site
edited by Kathleen Fitzpatrick (also the author of *Planned Obsolescence*,
2011); along with many others too numerous to mention here. These books and
projects have a common concern with the future of the academy, books, reading,
writing, and libraries. Paralleling developments in open access, creative
commons, and free culture, practitioners in this space aim to reform
contemporary institutions of knowledge production and often include critical
interventions that redress imbalances of access and participation along the
lines of gender, race, and geography. This categories capture the diversity of
practices in the field and help structure Part II of the book.

### Chapter 2: Intellectual Roots[^ln-roots]

This chapter will offer an introduction to the long-history of the digital
humanities and of quantitative approaches to the study of literature. Of
particular importance in this chapter is to counteract the common "shallow"
vision of the field, which sees its roots in "humanities computing" pioneered
by Father Roberto Busa in the 1940s. Instead the emphasis will be on the
influence of formalism on literary studies, its relationship to structuralism,
and post-structuralist critique. The chapter will progress with the development
of the field from "literary and linguistic computing" to the broader variety of
practices in the "digital humanities" as the field exists today.

[^ln-roots]: I took the option of combining the Background and Relevance chapters as suggested in the Guide to Submitted a Proposal for *Literature and Contemporary Thought* series.

## Part II: Theory and Practice

### Chapter 3: Computational Turn

The following three chapters follow the outline presented in the first. Each of
these will contain a case study, illustrating the impact of digital
humanities-inflected work on a specific problem or paradigm in traditional
literary scholarship.

Chapter three deals with the first of the three broad rubrics: computational
turn, knowledge design, and institutional transformation. I begin by
contextualizing the turn towards "distant reading" and computation in literary
studies within the larger "computational turn," affecting disciplines across
the university. The various approaches to distant reading include macroanalysis
in literary studies [@jockers_macroanalysis_2013; @moretti_distant_2013;
@ramsay_reading_2011], culturomics in economy [@aiden_uncharted_2014],
e-discovery in law [@scheindlin_electronic_2004; @scheindlin_scheindlin_2009],
automatic essay evaluation in education [@shermis_handbook_2013], and medical
informatics in medicine [@shortliffe_biomedical_2013], among others.

I will then summarize the variety methodologies common to these approaches,
including statistical natural language processing [@manning_foundations_1999;
@jurafsky_speech_2008], automatic summarization [@radev_centroid-based_2004;
@nenkova_pyramid_2007], machine learning [@rasmussen_gaussian_2006;
@flach_machine_2012], network analysis [@opsahl_node_2010;
@szell_measuring_2010; @takhteyev_geography_2012], and topic modeling
[@wallach_topic_2006; @blei_probabilistic_2012]. The chapter will conclude with
a case study, most likely chosen from one of the pamphlets published by Franco
Moretti's lab.

### Chapter 4: Knowledge Design

Chapter four will deal with what I call "knowledge design": a sphere of
scholarly activity that involves online critical edition making, archive
formation, digitization, creation of tagged corpora, collaborative annotation,
and textual interface design. As with the previous chapter, my aim here is to
show the continuity of these practices with long-standing concerns in literary
studies like textual criticism, print making, and book design.

Knowledge design, as I will then argue, is fundamental not only to the *study*
of literature, but also to the material structure of the literary encounter,
which affects all higher modes of reading, writing, and interpretation: close
and distant. The building of archives shapes the formation of shared cultural
memory, for example, just as e-book design may alter the readers understating
of the text. All forms of contemporary textuality (including print) pass
through some form of digital being, from typesetting tools to the building of
user interfaces from online book stores to search engines and e-book readers.
It is vital therefore that literary scholars do not leave these fundamentally
literary, textual concerns to technologists without deep humanistic training,
sensitive to history and cultural context.

The chapter will end with a case study from a prominent online archive of the
sort: something along the lines of the *Perseus Digital Library*, Andrew
Stauffer's *Book Traces* project, or Jerome McGann's *Rossetti Archive*.

### Chapter 5: Institutional Transformation

This chapter will highlight the work of scholars like Daniel Cohen, Joseph
Scheinfeldt, Alan Liu, Geoffrey Rockwell, Melissa Terras, Kathleen Fitzpatrick,
Tara McPherson, and Jessica Marie Johnson whose work often carries with it a
social and political dimension, aimed at transforming institutions of knowledge
production, reception, and dissemination. After highlighting several prominent
projects in that vein, I will ground this aspect of digital humanities in the
dual movement between critical theory and critical making. I will further
connect developments in this regard with broader social changes as exemplified
by the open access, creative commons, and free culture movements.

## Part III: Field Reflections

### Chapter 6: Literature Laboratories

The goal of this chapter is to introduce the reader to everyday "laboratory
life" as reflected by the activity of research groups whose work happens at the
intersection of literary studies and the digital humanities. To write this
chapter, I plan to interview (by email or in person) founders and primary
investigators from several distinct "literary labs." To these ends I have began
to make contacts Standford, University of Virginia, UCLA, Arizona State, MSU,
University of Nebraska, McGill, and Chicago among other institutions. From each
of these places I am soliciting responses to the following questions (to be
further refined in consultation with an anthropologist):

- What does it mean for you to run a "laboratory" in the humanities?
- Describe your space.
- How often do you meet?
- What is your governance structure?
- What roles do you assign to your participants?
- How do you handle issues of labor and attribution?
- How do you distribute your findings?
- What is your research program?
- What methodologies do you use?
- How does your work connect to literary and cultural studies?
- How do you handle training?
- What other fields / department are involved?

The chapter will conclude in a synthesis of the findings, in an attempt to
articulate best practices in the field.

### Chapter 7: Criticism and Ways Forward

This final chapter will contain an overview of at least two major lines of
criticism leveled against the digital humanities. These include:

1. Literature is not data (DH as reductive positivism, scientism,
compuationalism) [@fish_what_1979; @marche_literature_2012; @fish_digital_2012;
@golumbia_cultural_2009; @kirsch_technology_2014].

2. Mirroring the tech industry, the Digital Humanities privilege white,
Anglo-Centric, male, or commercialized modes of a- or anti-theoretical
discourse [@golumbia_cultural_2009; @mcpherson_why_2012;
@fiormonte_towards_2012; @liu_where_2012].

The chapter and the book will end with a productive discussion about what can
be done to mitigate some of these concerns, while connecting a robust sense of
critical theory with critical practice. Critical practice, as I will argue,
involves reclaiming the material bases of knowledge production. More than a set
of methodologies, the digital humanities ultimately enlarge our notions of
literature and textuality.

## Appendices

#### Appendix I: Annotated Reading List

This appendix will contain an annotated list of seminal books, articles, and
projects that can be used as a "springboard for further research or study" (as
per the Series Guidelines).

#### Appendix II: Glossary of Terms

This section will contain a glossary of key operational terms.

#### Appendix III: Becoming Digital

This section will contain a schematic for self-directed study in the humanities
and a blueprint for a possible curriculum for a certificate-granting program in
the field.

# Format and Timing

I estimate chapters of 10,000 words in length, which in combination with the
appendices will put the manuscript at roughly 80,000 words. The book will have
6--12 line drawings (figures and tables). I plan on having a draft of the
manuscript ready by January 1, 2016.
