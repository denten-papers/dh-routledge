## Reviewer 1

- Vagueness in case studies.
This is fair, although my intention was exactly to give an example of potential
cases rather than to commit to specific ones at this stage. This will naturally
resolve itself in the book.

- Significant amount of territory covered in Chapter 4 (Knowledge Design)
See the summary of changes under Ursula's suggestions.

- Chapter 6 methodology
Tanya Clement has confirmed her involvement.

- Chapter 7, "frustratingly, he only goes on to offer two bullet points"
I added detail on the avenues of critique.

- Incomplete sentence Part I Chapter 1
Fixed. It was an artifact of conversion from Markdown.

- Suggestion to switch 1 and 2
Chapter 1 is the Introduction as suggested by the series guidelines. I think it makes
sense to keep as is. It might be a bit jarring to plunge into the intellectual
history without understanding the what and the why.

- Scepticism about the non-academic market
Agreed. I cannot however find any mention of a non-academic audience in the
market section.

## Reviewer 2

- Computational methodologies are interrelated.
Agreed. Although, that is the point of putting them into the same chapter. In
highlighting these categories I have followed the standard practice in the
literature on the subject. See for example *Text Analysis with R for Students of
Literature* by Matthew L. Jockers and *Foundations of Statistical Natural
Language Processing* by Chris Manning and Hinrich Sch√ºtze.

- Chapter 4, much territory to cover
Agreed. See notes to Ursula's comments.

- Chapter 6 on DH Labs
Chapters 4 and 6 are receiving significant rewrites.

- Issues of gender, race, geography See summary of changes. My own lab
  dedicates significant resources to these issues. See for example our projects
on [#feminism action
defense](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/minimal-computing/action-defense.html)
and [Minimal
Computing](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/strains/minimal-computing.html), [Hate
Speech and Online
Activism](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/public-discourse/hate-speech-online-activists.html),
[Small Axe
Archipelagos](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/events/minimal-computing/small-axe.html),
and [Digital
Justice](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/minimal-computing/digital-justice.html).
However, despite recent advances (I was a contributer to the Around the World
project), DH remains a field dominated by North American concerns, morroring
the ineaualities found in STEM / IT fields more broadly. I plan to acknowledge
that imbalance throughout and dedicate a chapter discussing new directions and
possible correctives.

## Ursula's Comments
- Issues of gender, race, geography
I've expanded Chapter 7 description to clarify my argument.

- Scrapping the Lab chapater
Push back on this.

- Expand knowledge design
