# Statement of aims

The purpose of this volume is to introduce academic readers, along with
a broader audience, to the new and growing field of the Digital Humanities
(DH), particularly as that field interests with the research program in the
study of literature. My approach to writing a volume of this sort aims to
achieve two goals: *first*, descriptive, giving shape and intellectual history
to the variety of scholarly practices that loosely identify as the Digital
Humanities, and *second*, proscriptive, imagining an institutional future for
Digital Humanities that is more inclusive and more connected to related
developments in the life of the modern university.

As universities across the country and globally invest in programs related to
the DH movement,[ln-dh] a need arises for a programmatic, intellectual, and
institutional vision of a field that can guide the formation of certificate
programs, research labs, and undergraduate curricula. I plan for the present
volume to answer the demand for such a text and to go further in creating
a paradigmatic "introduction to the field," which can go on to serve as a
foundational building block in the DH-inflected study of literature.

Beyond these goals, I join

I hope for *Plain Text* to become a standard text that
introduces faculty and advanced graduate students to the notion of critical
practice in humanities computing.

[^ln-dh]: For example: In February 2015, U. Penn received $7,000,000 from Penn
Arts and Sciences Overseer to establish the Price Lab for the Digital
Humanities. In December 2014, Yale announced an award in the amount of
$3,000,000 from The Goizueta Foundation to inaugurate the Digital Humanities
Laboratory. UC Berkeley announced $2,000,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation to advance digital humanities. Stanford has recently launched the
Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. University of Michigan opened six new
tenure-track searches in a hiring cluster under the rubric of Public Humanities
in a Digital World in 2012. In May of 2014, Bard College was Awarded $800,000
from Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support Experimental Humanities.

2. Definition of the market: Identify as accurately as possible the intended

market for your proposed work. Please list the main readership first and indicate as

specifically as possible which courses or modules might use your book. This may

include, for example, introductory undergraduate core courses; upper-level

undergraduate options or modules; post-graduate courses; professional courses or in-
service training. Also list any secondary markets for your book.

Where possible, give rough estimates of the size of each market (the numbers of

students or numbers of universities or colleges offering the course), and indicate the

basis on which you reached your estimate. A list of institutions which offer such

courses is particularly useful.

If there are particular international markets for your book outside your own domestic

market which you feel are relevant, please also outline these.

3. Review of competitive books: Briefly review each of the main competitors to

your work. These could be books covering the same subject matter or books which

are used as set texts in courses in which you hope your book could be used as a

substitute or additional text. Please indicate author, title, publisher, price, date of

publication, length, hardback and/or paperback. Identify the strengths and weaknesses

of each book, and how your book will be different/better. If different books are used

in domestic and international markets, please also provide details for these

competitors. If there are no direct rivals, review the books which are most similar to

your proposed book.

4. Chapter Outline: Please list chapter headings and provide at least one

paragraph of explanation on what you intend to cover in each chapter. Indicate the

basic structure and features of each chapter, e.g. introduction, argument summary,

case studies, questions for discussion, assignments, further reading. For the Literature

and Contemporary Thought series, the basic structure should follow these guidelines:

• Chapter 1

• Chapter 2

• Chapter 3

• Chapters 4-10

• Each book should contain a glossary of terms and words that readers may

• Rather than taking a historical approach, the first chapter should be

called something like "Literature and Philosophy/Digital

Humanities/Science/Animals/Food Now."

• It should explain why the topic is relevant, interesting and important at

this moment and how it relates to contemporary debates. 

• It should raise the questions that the rest of the book will answer.

• This chapter can then offer a background and a brief introduction to the

particular area of study the book is intended to cover.

• should explain at what point this area of study became relevant to

literature, how the relationship between the two areas was initially

perceived – opposing, complementary etc. – and how it evolved.

• The following chapters should then trace the history, arguments and

debates involved in the topic full circle, returning to the issues raised in

the initial chapter.

not be familiar with (especially if the book deals with topics such as

science or philosophy).

• The book should also include a list of annotated further reading

suggestions so that it can be used as a springboard for further research or

study.

There is some flexibility in this structure (e.g. in certain cases the second and third

chapters might meaningfully be merged into one), but whatever chapter structure the

proposal adopts needs to cover the basic dimensions outlined here.

5. Format: Please indicate how long you think the manuscript will be, giving a

total number of words. Most manuscripts in the Literature and Contemporary

Thought series should be between 60,000 and 80,000 words in length. If you plan to

include illustrations in the book, please state how many, and whether they will be

line-drawings (figures, tables etc.) or half-tone illustrations (photographs). If possible,

indicate the source of these images, so that we can form a rough idea of likely

reproduction costs.

6. Timing: Please give a realistic date when you intend to submit the complete

manuscript.
