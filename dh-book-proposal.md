# Statement of aims

The purpose of this volume is to introduce academic readers, along with
a broader audience, to the new and growing field of the Digital Humanities
(DH), particularly as that field interests with the research program in the
study of literature. My approach to writing a volume of this sort aims to
achieve two goals: *first*, descriptive, giving shape and intellectual history
to the variety of scholarly practices that loosely identify as the Digital
Humanities, and *second*, proscriptive, imagining an intellectual future for
Digital Humanities that is more inclusive and more intelligible to concomitant
developments in the life of the modern university.

As universities across the country and globally invest in programs related to
the DH movement,[^ln-dh] a need arises for a programmatic vision of a field
that can guide the formation of certificate programs, research labs, and
undergraduate curricula. I plan for the present volume to answer the demand for
such a vision and to go further in creating a paradigmatic "introduction to the
field," which can go on to serve as a foundational text in the study of
literature inflected by the Digital Humanities. Beyond these goals, I join the
editors of the Routledge *Literature and Contemporary Thought* series in the
desire to create a mutually-enriching dialog between literary criticism,
theory, and recent developments in the digital humanities and computational
culture studies.

[^ln-dh]: For example: In February 2015, U. Penn received $7,000,000 from Penn
Arts and Sciences Overseer to establish the Price Lab for the Digital
Humanities. In December 2014, Yale announced an award in the amount of
$3,000,000 from The Goizueta Foundation to inaugurate the Digital Humanities
Laboratory. UC Berkeley announced $2,000,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation to advance digital humanities. Stanford has recently launched the
Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. University of Michigan opened six new
tenure-track searches in a hiring cluster under the rubric of Public Humanities
in a Digital World in 2012. In May of 2014, Bard College was Awarded $800,000
from Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support Experimental Humanities. The
Claremont Colleges received $1,500,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to
develop the digital humanities.

# Definition of the market

The primary market for the *Literature and the Digital Humanities* includes:

- advanced undergraduate courses in literary studies wishing to introduce
their students to the field of digital humanities and computational culture
studies;

- introductory level graduate courses for all doctorate and MA-level students
entering the field of literary studies, covering DH as part of their "Intro to
the Field," "Pro Seminar," or "MA seminar," as required in most language and
literature programs globally and across the country;

- the large share of self-directed graduate students whose institutions do not offer DH
training;

- faculty and staff (librarians, officers of scholarly publication) interested
in expanding their research and activity in the field.

A secondary market for the book includes students and scholars in engineering
schools interested in finding productive intersections between literary studies
and computer science.

Several prominent institutions are beginning to offer degree- or certificate-
granting programs in Digital Humanities. These include MA, PhD, and
undergraduate programs at Kingâ€™s College London; MA and undergraduate programs
at Loyola University, Chicago; the Digital Humanities Minor at UCLA; the DH
undergraduate program at Michigan State University; the DH and Technology
program at Brigham Young; the MA program in Humanities Computing at University
of Alberta, Canada; the PhD, MA, and undergraduate programs at University
College, London and University College, Cork; the MA program in DH at CUNY; the
Digital Cultures and Creativity undergraduate program at University of
Maryland; the MA in DH at Brandeis University; the M.A. in Digital Humanities
at the University of Virginia; Media Technology and Games program at the IT
University of Copenhagen; MA and PhD in Digital Humanities at Maynooth
University, Ireland; the Digital Media and Cultural Theory undergraduate
program at Hampshire College; the Certificate program in DH at University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill; the Arts, Media + Engineering undergraduate
program at Arizona State; the Bachelor of Science in Digital Humanities at the
Illinois Institute of Technology and many others along with undergraduate
minors and non-degree granting research centers that offer courses too numerous
to mention here.

Although I have concentrated my summary of potential markets to universities in
English-speaking countries (primarily Canada, the Republic of Ireland, the
United Kingdom, and the United States), there are significant markets for
English-language work in DH globally. Swedish, German, Israeli, and Danish
institutions are particularly strong in this field and commonly assign English
texts.

# Review of the main competitive books

There is a paucity of texts that occupy the niche targeted by the Literature
and Comparative Thought series at the intersection of DH and literary studies.
Before getting to the individual comparables, allow me speak to the market at
large.

The first generation of books about the Digital Humanities retained an
expansionary, manifesto-like quality, important to the early development of the
field. These spoke generally to "the humanities" (rather than addressing
a specific discipline): they often took shape in edited collections, as was the
case with the seminal *Companion to Digital Humanities* (Willey-Blackwell,
2004)[^ln-comp]; compendia of essays and blog posts, as was the case with
*Debates in Digital Humanities* (Minnesota, 2012)[^ln-debates]; co-authored
volumes like *Digital_Humanities* (MIT, 2012) Digital_Humanities by Jeffrey
Schnapp, Johanna Drucker, Anne Burdick, Peter Lunenfeld, and Todd
Presner[^ln-dh2]; and, finally, as institutional set pieces written by prominent
public intellectuals and administrators like the 2013 *Hacking the Academy: New
Approaches to Scholarship and Teaching from Digital Humanities* by Dan Cohen
and Joseph Scheinfeldt (Michigan UP).[^ln-up]

[^ln-comp]: Ed. John M. Unsworth, Susan Schreibman, and Ray Siemens. 640 pages.
$59.95 paper, $235.95 cloth.

[^ln-debates]: Ed. Matt Gold. 504 pages. $34.95 paper, $20.86 ebook, $99.75 cloth.

[^ln-dh2]: 152 pages. $24.99 trade or ebook.

[^ln-up]: 176 pages. $22.95 paper or ebook, $70 cloth.

The current, "second generation," wave of DH is beginning to absorb the impact
of the research program and administrative reform into its constituent fields.
I hold that such specification is not only necessary, but also that it reaches
a much wider audience. Few publics care about "the humanities" in the abstract,
and less so colleagues from sciences and the arts whose practice was already
significantly impacted by computational methodology and through other
vagrancies of the advancing digital condition. The application of the Digital
Humanities to specific questions in literary scholarship, as they manifest in
pressing problems of collaborative authorship, digital storytelling, the
quality of online deliberation, and in the politics of the archive and shared
memory formation (to name just a few), begin to gain a measure of specificity
that points to concrete ways of collaboration between diverse practitioners.
Such questions are interesting to computer scientists and game designers alike.

A small number of recent books have began to direct generalist DH approaches
and methodologies to the questions and traditions governing their specific area
of expertise. To these we may attribute *Writing History in the Digital Age
(Michigan UP, 2013),^[ln-hist], *Digital Critical Editions* (U of Illinois,
2014),[^ln-critical] and *Oral History and Digital Humanities: Voice, Access,
and Engagement* (Palgrave, 2014).[^ln-palgrave]

[^ln-hist]: Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki. 322 pages. $29.95 ebook and
paper, $80 cloth.

[^ln-critical]: Ed. Daniel Apollon et. al. 368 pages. $65 cloth. $30 ebook.

[^ln-palgrave]: Ed. Douglas A. Boyd and Mary A. Larson. 256 pages. $90 cloth,
$16.50 ebook, $25 paper.

The major (and few of the only) volumes in the nascent second generation
pertinent to the study of literature is *Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and
Literary History* by Matthew L. Jockers (Illinois, 2013),[^ln-macro] which is
itself a more technical extension of a far more influential *Distant Reading*,
by Franco Moretti (Verso, 2013).[^ln-franco]

[^ln-macro]: 208 pages. $30 paper and ebook, $90 cloth.

[^ln-franco]: 224 pages. $29.95 paper, $24.95 ebook, $95 cloth.

Although respected in the DH community, *Macroanalysis* was not received well
by wider community of literary scholars. This could be due in part to its
rather terse, technical nature, and in part to its failure to connect to the
literary-theoretical tradition. Jockers writes as an engineer visiting literary
studies (where it should be the other way around). The work is full of specific
technologies: computer language libraries and software tools that are bound to
become obsolete shortly after publication. Similar to Stephen Ramsey's *Reading
Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism* (published in the same series in
2011[^ln-ramsey]), *Macroanalysis* promises nothing less than a revolution (an
often repeated phrase in both books), but delivers only modest confirmation of
accepted knowledge.

[^ln-ramsey]: University of Illinois Press. 108 pages. $25 paper, $65 cloth.

In *Literature and the Digital Humanities* I plan to take a different tack.
Rather than describing a revolution, my approach connects the history of the
discipline to the Digital Humanities research program in an evolutionary way.
Going beyond computation, I plan to describe DH as an expansion of the
literary-critical tradition, opening up to new archives of study and to new
methodologies. My book ends with a productive critique of the field itself:
noting its successes and outlining strategies to remedy its failures. I want my
reader to leave the book with a sense of possibility: perceiving rich and yet
unexplored areas of scholarship needing our urgent attention.

# Chapter Outline

### Chapter 1: Literature and Digital Humanities

As specified by the series editors the first chapter will outline the relevance
of the topic, relating it to contemporary debates in literary studies and
digital humanities, "raising the questions that the rest of the book will
answer." Beyond academic debates, I will outline the broadly cultural relevance
of problems that can motivate scholarly interest at the intersection of these
two fields.

## Part I: History

### Chapter 2: Intellectual Roots

This chapter will offer an introduction to the long-history of the digital
humanities and of quantitative approaches to the study of literature. Of
particular importance in this chapter is to counteract the common "shallow"
vision of the field, which sees its roots in "humanities computing" pioneered
by Father Roberto Busa in the 1940s. Instead the emphasis will be on the
influence of formalism on literary studies, its relationship to structuralism,
and post-structuralist critique.

### Chapter 3: Humanities Computing

This chapter will discuss the application of computational methods to literary
studies more narrowly. A case study in authorship attribution will help
illustrate the chapter.

### Chapter 4: The Rise of DH

Chapter 4 will contain an outline the much broader intellectual and
institutional program of the Digital Humanities. The relationship between
making and knowing. Several case studies will illustrate the strengths and the
weaknesses of the approach.

## Part II: Theory & Practice

The next three chapters outline contemporary developments in digital
humanities, along the lines of the "three pillars" used to capture the
diversity in contemporary thought and practice. I will be slightly more
schematic in describing these chapters to avoid repetition.

### Chapter 5: Computational Culture Studies

Contextualizing Humanities Computing and the Digital Humanities within the
larger "computational turn" affecting all disciplines of human knowledge
production. The computational turn as (1) a set of new problems posed by
quantification of human experience and the ubiquity of computing devices and
(2) as methodology offering insight at new scales of analysis.

### Chapter 7: Knowledge Design

The changing mechanics of knowledge production and dissemination. Cultural
memory and personal archives. Textual interfaces (ebooks and word processors).
Future of reading. Shared knowledge formation (Wikipedia and Stack Exchange).
The difference between computer science and software engineering and their
relevance to the study of literature.

### Chapter 8: Institutional Change

The rapidly changing dynamics of book publishing. The changing nature of
scientific knowledge (reproducibility and access to findings). Transforming
institutions of learning. Digital pedagogy. Transparency in governance. Global issues.

## Part III: Ways Forward

### Chapter 9: Everyday Literature

In this chapter will examine the ways in which the Digital Humanities challenge
conventional notions of literary production. A case study in our daily
encounter with text and computation.

### Chapter 10: Textual Contagion

In this chapter, I will examine the life of texts outside of academia. The two
case studies here will come from the Courtroom and from the Hospital. In
looking at both of these places as a type of information-processing
environment, I will speculate on the role of a literary scholar in the 21st
century.

### Chapter 11: Life in a Humanities Lab

In this chapter, I will describe the challenges of running a laboratory in the humanities. Making good on the metaphor of the laboratory. Best practices. This section will describe day-to-day operation of Columbia's Group for Experimental Method in the Humanities.

### Appendix I: Annotated Reading List

As specified by the editors "the book should also include a list of annotated
further reading suggestions so that it can be used as a springboard for further
research or study."

### Appendix II: Glossary of terms

This section containing a glossary of key operational terms, as requested.

### Appendix III: Becoming Digital

This appendix will contain a schematic for self-directed study in the humanities and a blueprint for a possible curriculum for a certificate-granting program in the field.

# Format & Timing

I write concisely and prefer short chapters between 5,000-8,000 words in length, giving the book the desired length between 60,000 and 80,000 words. Although no illustrations are necessary, the book will have 6-12 line drawings (figures and tables).

I plan on having a draft of the manuscript ready by January 1, 2016.
