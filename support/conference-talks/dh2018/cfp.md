Hello! I'm writing to see if you would be interested in being part of a panel
on "Experimental Humanities" at DH 2018, which is taking place in Mexico City
from the 26-29 of June.

I'm organizing this as the director of the Experimental Humanities program and
center at Bard College, together with Dennis Yi Tenen, co-founder of the Group
for Experimental Methods in the Humanities at Columbia.

We're looking to include a range of humanities scholars who conceive of their
work beyond the digital: at the boundary between the university and the world,
engaging in issues of social justice and advocacy, or using empirical
methods---such as map-making or field work---in an approach to the study of
literature and culture. We are interested in experimentation both in the sense
of a scientific, exact method and in the sense of a radical, process-based
practice, the outcome of which remains highly subjective, speculative, and
unknown.

Given your work with XXX, we thought it would be fantastic to have you on
board. The final deadline for panel proposals is November 27, and will need to
include an  abstract (up to 500 words) of your planned paper or remarks. If
you are interested in doing this, please let me know as soon as possible -
ideally by Monday, November 6 - and plan to send me your abstract by Monday,
November 20.

Thanks for your time, and we hope you can join us!
